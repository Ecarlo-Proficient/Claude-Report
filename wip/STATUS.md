## DONE / FINALIZED

- **Test-Master is the deliverable WIP report** (2026-07-16): "WIP REPORT as of
  <date>" banner, rows 1–2 reserved as logo space (embedded images survive every
  sync), TOTALS row on live `SUBTOTAL(109,…)` (re-totals with the table filter),
  FUTURE WIP CASH FLOW block derived from the TOTALS row.
- **Identifiers are grab-able** (2026-07-16): PROJECT #/NAME cells are plain
  text; folder + data-source links moved to their own PROJECT FOLDER /
  DATA SOURCE columns. OVERBILLINGS/UNDERBILLINGS headers shortened to fit.
  FLAGS states the classify reason on red rows (never "OK" on red).
- **User cell comments survive every sync** (2026-07-16): harvested by
  (PROJECT #, header) before the full-replace, re-attached after; a comment
  whose line left the tab prints loudly instead of vanishing.
- **General List AF = OTHER excludes the flatwork scope** (2026-07-16): POUR
  FLATWORK col AF "OTHER" ⇒ another contractor won it — no -FTW line even when
  priced, no flat $ in CP-standalone sums; slab line stays with a note.
- **RP done-rule + FTW backlog model** (2026-07-14, unchanged): billing is the
  truth; backlog = -FTW with no QBO activity and not on today's schedule.

## IN PROGRESS

- **Schedule-driven RP method — preview stage** (`one-offs/rp_schedule_wip_preview.py`):
  Main Schedule tab = active-jobs truth (the General List lags it); contract =
  bid proposal **PDF only** (signed doc; no takeoff bid-sheet substitution);
  ETC = takeoff cost sheet's own subtotal cells (side-scope files whole-sheet,
  base files SL+PR vs FW; items-vs-subtotal mismatches flagged). Output: one
  audit xlsx in Downloads (NEW / CHANGED / MATCHES vs the GL), yellow = GL
  numbers, green = source-doc numbers, NEEDS color-coded (blue = cost/ETC,
  orange = contract/proposal), $ cells open the source, file cells open the
  folder with a `CURRENT PROJECTS > …` breadcrumb for Windows users.
  **NOT wired into rp_wip_reader yet — awaiting the user's approval.**
- **JobTread as a budget source — verified, not wired**: Pave API grant key in
  the shared vault (`JT_GRANT_KEY`); schema proven (`one-offs/jobtread_probe.py`):
  approved `customerOrder` document → price = CONTRACT, cost = ETC; line names
  are the QBO item cost codes (SL1…) so budget-vs-actual per cost code is a
  direct join. Coverage gap: newest RP74xx–75xx cohort mostly absent/empty in
  JT. Planned source chain: JT approved proposal → proposal PDF/takeoff → GL.

## TO DO

- [ ] Wire the source chain (JobTread → PDF/takeoff → GL) into the preview so
      the sources can be compared per row; then, on approval, into
      `rp_wip_reader.py` itself.
- [ ] Coverage nag: flag schedule-active jobs missing a JT approved proposal
      and/or a priced proposal PDF (the orange NEEDS flags are the seed).
- [ ] Guard `read_general_list()` against suffixed `RP####-FTW` rows in col C
      (latent: regex strips the suffix and dedupe would silently merge — zero
      such rows exist today, verified 2026-07-21).
- [ ] Change-order staleness: a JT/PDF contract with QBO billed above it should
      flag "CO not entered at the source" (billed-over-contract red already
      exists; wants a source-aware message).
- [ ] Decide the fate of the WHY (TEMP) column on Test - RP once the
      justification workbook workflow settles.

## OPEN ISSUES

- Schedule→General List lag is real and recurring (26 schedule-active lines
  missing from the WIP as of the 7-20-26 schedule run; was 20 on 7-17-26).
  Process owner needed for entering new jobs in the GL (or the schedule method
  replaces the GL as the active-list source).
- Several active jobs have takeoff cost > proposal price (negative implied
  margin flags in the preview) — usually a stale proposal PDF vs a grown
  takeoff; estimator review needed per orange/blue NEEDS flags.
- `-FTW` scopes on the flatwork schedule with no flatwork-named proposal PDF or
  takeoff anywhere (pricing exists in no readable source).
- Excel cannot gate hyperlinks behind ctrl/cmd-click (asked 2026-07-16;
  answered with the plain-text identifier columns + click-and-hold).
